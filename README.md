## CardioTF Database
User can visit [cardioTF database](http://www.cardiosignal.org/database/cardiotf.html). This database is a
complementary version to the CardioSignal database. Both databases aim to establish the gene regulatory 
networks in heart development. These scripts published here were 
used to biocurate the data and do text analysis to define the core cardiac factors. Raw data and intermediary files can be 
downloaded at the [host site](http://www.cardiosignal.org/download/download.html) at AWS. The scripts and raw data can be used to verify  my findings in [my recent work, PMID:27635320](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=cardioTF+database) which were peer-reviewed by two anonymous colleagues
and one real name reviewer.
